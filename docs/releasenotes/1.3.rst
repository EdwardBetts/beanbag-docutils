====================
beanbag-docutils 1.3
====================

**Release date:** May 23, 2017


New Features
============

* Added :py:mod:`beanbag_docutils.sphinx.ext.intersphinx_utils`, which adds
  new features for intersphinx lookups.

  This adds a :rst:dir:`default-intersphinx` directive that allows for
  specifying one or more intersphinx set prefixes that should be tried if a
  reference could not be found. For example:

  .. code-block:: rst

      .. default-intersphinx:: myapp1.5, python

      :ref:`some-reference`

  This does affect the process by which missing references are located. If an
  unprefixed reference is used, it will only match if the prefix is in the list
  above, which differs from the default behavior of looking through all
  intersphinx mappings.

  This also works around an issue with :rst:role:`option` (see
  https://github.com/sphinx-doc/sphinx/pull/3769 for the equivalent upstream
  fix).
