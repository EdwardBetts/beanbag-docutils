====================
beanbag-docutils 2.1
====================

**Release date:** February 4, 2023


Packaging / Compatibility
=========================

* Added support for Sphinx 6.

* Updated the Sphinx dependency to require version 4 or higher.

* Removed a dependency on ``six``.


beanbag_docutils.sphinx.ext.autodoc_utils
=========================================

* Fixed performing incremental builds.

  Due to a bug, all builds were being treated as full builds.

* ``__annotations__`` are now excluded from generated docs by default.


beanbag_docutils.sphinx.ext.github
==================================

* Added support for custom GitHub URLs.

  A GitHub URL (useful for GitHub Enterprise) can now be set by passing
  ``github_url=`` to
  :py:func:`~beanbag_docutils.sphinx.ext.github.github_linkcode_resolve`.

* Fixed generating links to GitHub when failing to resolve tracking branches.

  These links were appearing broken before. Now, if a tracking branch can't
  be resolved, the links will point to the file on GitHub without a stable
  SHA.


beanbag_docutils.sphinx.ext.image_srcsets
=========================================

* Added the new :py:mod:`~beanbag_docutils.sphinx.ext.image_srcsets` Sphinx
  extension.

  This extension enables multi-DPI/responsive images to be used in generated
  documentation.

  It's intended to replace :rst:dir:`image` and can be used like:

  .. code-block:: restructuredtext

     .. image:: path/to/file.png
        :sources: 2x path/to/file@2x.png
                  3x path/to/file@3x.png
                  100w path/to/file@100w.svg
                  200h path/to/file@200h.svg
