====================
beanbag-docutils 2.4
====================

**Release date:** TBD


Packaging / Compatibility
=========================

* Added support for Sphinx 7.3.

* Removed unused ``six`` imports, which broke using the module unless
  the :pypi:`six` package was explicitly installed.

  This was a regression caused by 2.3's packaging.
