====================
beanbag-docutils 2.3
====================

**Release date:** October 15, 2023


Packaging / Compatibility
=========================

* Added support for Sphinx 7.2.


beanbag_docutils.sphinx.ext.image_srcsets
=========================================

* Images with widths/heights now have ``width`` and ``height`` attributes
  set.

  Sphinx turns widths and heights into ``style="width: ...; height: ..."``
  attributes, but does not set the dedicated ``width`` and ``height``
  attributes. These attributes are helpful for the browser when computing
  layout and aspect ratios, and are not deprecated or strictly interchangeable
  with the CSS styles.

  This extension now sets these attributes and strips them out of any CSS
  styling.
