====================
beanbag-docutils 1.1
====================

**Release date:** November 18, 2016


New Features
============

* Added :py:mod:`beanbag_docutils.sphinx.ext.extlinks` for defining
  anchor-aware external links.

  Sphinx ships with a :py:mod:`sphinx.ext.extlinks` extension, which allows
  for defining roles that map to external links. These take a URL that work as
  a format string, containing a ``%s``. The reference is then passed into
  that, and the result is a URL embedded in the page.

  This is very useful, but has a flaw in that anchors do not work with
  these links. If the format string has any content after the ``%s``, then
  that content will appear after the anchor. Support for this is being
  tracked upstream by Sphinx, but as of yet there isn't any indication of
  a plan to implement anchor support.

  This extension adds that anchor support, building upon the logic in
  Sphinx's extension and adding a shim that handles anchor-safe string
  formatting. It's a drop-in replacement that can be used without changing
  any configuration, meaning we can remove it down the road without any
  real work if Sphinx ends up fixing this upstream.
