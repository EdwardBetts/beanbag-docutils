====================
beanbag-docutils 1.2
====================

**Release date:** January 21, 2017


New Features
============

* Added :py:mod:`beanbag_docutils.sphinx.ext.collect_files` for collecting
  additional files in a build.

  This is used to copy files (indicated by glob patterns) from the source
  directory into the destination build directory. Each destination file will be
  in the same relative place in the tree.

  This is useful when you have non-ReST/image files that you want part of your
  built set of files, perhaps containing metadata or packaging that you want to
  ship along with the documentation.

  To use this, you just need to add the extension in :file:`conf.py`:

  .. code-block:: python

      extensions = [
          ...
          'beanbag_docutils.sphinx.ext.collect_files',
          ...
      ]

  And then configure ``collect_file_patterns`` to be a list of
  filenames/glob patterns, like:

  .. code-block:: python

      collect_file_patterns = ['metadata.json', '*.pdf']
